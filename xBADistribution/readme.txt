Run xBADistribution.py by executing 'python3 xBADistribution.py'. A prompt for a first and last name will appear as well as a start and end date. There is not yet error checking for any of the inputs. The date range can only handle starting and ending within the same year. The function pulls batted ball data for the player entered over the date range from Baseball Savant, calculates the xBA using individual batted ball estimated hit probability with Monte Carlo methods. It then plots the histogram of all xBA outcomes with the mean xBA and the actual BA over that same span.
