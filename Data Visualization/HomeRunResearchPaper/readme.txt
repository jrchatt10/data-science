Jim Chatterton Final Project Code

The code for the final project is the chatterton_final_project.py file. It uses Python3 to run. Execute it by running `python3 chatterton_final_project.py`.

Running the code requires an internet connection as the code reaches out to baseballsavant.com to pull down the necessary dataset to use for the visualizations.

The code will produce 16 charts in the default web browser using Plotly.
